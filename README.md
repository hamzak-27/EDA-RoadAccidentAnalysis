# EDA-RoadAccidentAnalysis

This Jupyter Notebook conducts an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of road accidents using a dataset named "Accident_Information.csv." The notebook covers data cleaning and basic EDA, providing insights into various factors affecting road accidents.

**Features:**
 - Data Cleaning: Drops unnecessary columns and handles missing values to prepare the dataset for analysis.
 - Casualty Analysis: Examines the number of casualties based on accident severity, day of the week, and various other factors like road type and speed limit.
 - Temporal Trends: Studies accidents over different timescales (daily, monthly, yearly) and explores how certain conditions (like weather or road surface) influence accident rates.
 - Visualizations: Includes pie charts, bar graphs, and line plots to visually summarize the findings and trends in the data.
 - Correlation Study: Analyzes the correlations between different data attributes to identify potential influences on accident outcomes.


The notebook employs libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform the analysis and visualize the results.
